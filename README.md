# Diagram As Text

The tool to generate diagram based on textual description.

🚀🚀🚀 _Mission_: to enable anyone to explain complex system, or process in a simple way.

🚀🚀 _Objective_: to streamline knowledge sharing through diagrams.

🚀 _MVP_: plain english to [C4 container](http://c4model.com/) diagrams.

The work is driven by the motivation to streamline knowledge sharing by enabling effective generation of visual
materials. We aim to take a step beyond the "diagram as code" approach and remove the additional step between the idea
of what shall be displayed and the illustration.

We all know that “a picture is worth a thousand words”. Although it takes quite some effort to make a diagram, LLM is
here for the rescue! All one needs is, a description in plain English to get desired result in no time! 🤖🦾
